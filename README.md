# Blockchain-based Medical Records
## 📄 Abstract
Blockchain has the ability to keep an incorruptible, decentralized, and transparent log of all patient data makes it a technology rife for security applications. Additionally, while blockchain is transparent it is also private, concealing the identity of any individual with complex and secure codes that can protect the sensitivity of medical data. The decentralized nature of the technology also allows patients, doctors, and healthcare providers to share the same information quickly and safely.

## 🗒️ Introduction
This project greatly increases the efficiency of the hospital staff as a whole. The pandemic has led to a lot of hospitals being completely occupied, and the hostel staff overwhelmed. By not having to conduct manual routine checks on the drip levels and drip conditions of every patient, the workload of the hospital staff is exceedingly diminished. Automation in such essential tasks is the next step towards providing more efficient and convenient healthcare.

### ⚙ Working
The block diagram above represents the correct working of the model in that first it will take input from the Doctor regarding all the data of the patient and then Doctor will input the data and once the data is saved on the blockchain network and once it is stored on the blockchain network no one can modify that data since it is on the blockchain network.

### 🔑 KEY FEATURES OF THE APP
- Data is stored on the blockchain network.
- Once the Medical Records are inserted then no one can modify them.
- Safe and secure on the Blockchain Network

### 🌈 CONCLUSION
The proposed solution is going to remove all sorts of Unfairness which sometimes hospital staff does in order to manipulate the data.

### FUTURE PROSPECT
- To make our system more useful and convinient, we plan on adding whole management data inside this blockchain Network.
